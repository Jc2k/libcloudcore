Only you (as owner of the queue) can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see `Shared Queues <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/acp-overview.html>`_ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n\n  ``AddPermission`` writes an Amazon SQS-generated policy. If you want to write your own policy, use SetQueueAttributes to upload your policy. For more information about writing your own policy, see `Using The Access Policy Language <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AccessPolicyLanguage.html>`_ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.\n\n  Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the ``param.n`` notation. Values of ``n`` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:  ``Attribute.1=this``\n\n ``Attribute.2=that``",

(For more information visibility timeout, see `Visibility Timeout <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html>`_ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.)\n\n For example, let's say you have a message and its default message visibility timeout is 30 minutes. You could call ``ChangeMessageVisiblity`` with a value of two hours and the effective timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that time comes near you could again extend the time out by calling ChangeMessageVisiblity, but this time the maximum allowed timeout would be 9 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n There is a 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages per queue. Messages are inflight after they have been received from the queue by a consuming component, but have not yet been deleted from the queue. If you reach the 120,000 limit, you will receive an OverLimit error message from Amazon SQS. To help avoid reaching the limit, you should delete the messages from the queue after they have been processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process the messages. \n\n If you attempt to set the ``VisibilityTimeout`` to an amount more than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time remaining. Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message the next time it is received reverts to the original timeout value, not the value you set with the ``ChangeMessageVisibility`` action.",
